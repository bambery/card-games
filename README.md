# Card Games

Halfway through a phonescreen, the connection died and all I got for the coding
question was "Assume you need to design a card game". I really wanted to answer
this question! Card & board games are my jam! I'm a bit rusty on my Ruby, so 
this is a fun opportunity to write some text based card games.

Without someone else dictating the requirements, I sort of just started 
imagining what the games would look like. Formal requirements, tests, and a 
general code cleanup are the next step.
